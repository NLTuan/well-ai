By contrast, patients with type I diabetes (without renal disease) have a risk of hypertension similar to that of the general population. - Hypertension is an important contributor to the macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes. - The threshold for treatment is lower than that for the general population: 140/90 mmHg. - The target of treatment is a BP <140/80 mmHg. Most patients require two or more drugs to achieve this.

Taking this medication does not change the goals or principles of the optimum diet described above but patients should be aware of the potential for weight gain if prescribed sulphonylurea or thiazolinediones and of the small possibility of hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemia Acute hypoglycaemia should be treated with 10–20 g of glucose orally in conscious patients. If this is not available, regular sugar (sucrose) or a sugary drink can be given, although this will not be effective in patients taking the A-glucosidase inhibitor, acarbose. On recovery, a further 10–20 g of slower-acting carbohydrate (see box) should be given unless the next meal or snack is due, in which case this should be eaten as\n",

These changes inhibit the insulin signalling cascade resulting in impaired glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle and stimulated hepatic gluconeogenesis with consequent hyper-glycaemia. Clinical consequences Diabetes is associated with i risk of serious chronic ill health, disability, and premature mortality. Long-term complications include macrovascular disease, leading to cardiovascular disease and i risk of stroke, and microvascular disease leading to retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuro- pathy. People with diabetes also have a greater risk of suffering from infections, cataracts and depression. Many of these complications can be minimized or avoided by earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment (see box).\n",

Environ- mental factors, such as viral infection, may be implicated. Type 2 diabetes is closely associated with obesity and genetic factors. Approximately 15–25% of first-degree relatives of people with type 2 diabetes develop impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes. However, the substantial contribution made by obesity is particularly important as this is a potentially modifiable risk factor. Excess body fat, stored as lipid in the adipocytes, is associated with i levels of circulating hormones, cyto- kines, and metabolic fuels (e.g. free fatty acids), which modulate the effect of insulin. Large adipocytes, especially in abdominal fat, are resistant to the lipolytic effects of insulin, which leads to a further release and then increase in\n",

Controlling expenditures: implications for public health practitioners You might have two reactions to this issue: ﬁ rst, that this is somebody else’s problem; secondly, that there is nothing you can do about it anyway. If your reaction is the ﬁ rst of these then bear in mind that rising health care costs tend to occur at the downstream end of health care, but to draw yet more resources away from effective upstream interventions. If we, collectively, fail to control health care expenditure a likely consequence is a squeezing of public health budgets and a reduction in our capacity to address potential health problems, in an equitable fashion, before they arise. The more resources are drawn away from public health, the more need there will be to spend money to deal with health problems that could\n",
