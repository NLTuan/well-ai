The diagnosis (or diagnostic formulation) may have to include prediction about past, present, and future, causes, consequences, interactions, and other independent processes. As well as internal medical processes, it has to include external factors such as circumstances at home and the effects on self-care, employment, and leisure. It is important to establish very clearly why the patient has sought help. This is known as the presenting complaint. Ask about its severity and dura - tion.
