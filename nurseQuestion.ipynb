No cause is found in up to 5% patients. As this symptom is non-life-threatening, initial management can be delayed until the exact cause is found. Initial investigations (other tests in bold below): FBC, U&E, CXR. Main differential diagnoses and typical outline evidence, etc. Smoking Suggested by: smoking history. Confirmed by: stopping smoking, cough often worsens initially as ciliary motility is restored, but improves within 3mo. Finalized by the predictable outcome of management, e.g. giving generic advice and adjunct pharmacotherapy. Referring to smoking cessation specialist, if available, and patient is keen to stop. Chronic asthmaSuggested by: chronic cough, worse at night and early morning. Seasonal variation and other specific triggers (e.g. aerosol sprays, cold air, perfumes, smoke, infections exercise, etc.). Family\n",

      "COUGH WITH SPUTUM 249 Lung abscess Suggested by: days or weeks of copious and foul-smelling sputum, fever, chest pain. Typically preceded by a prior significant respiratory infection (e.g. pneumonia). Confirmed by: CXR : circular opacity with fluid level, sputum culture/culture of CT guided aspirate. Finalized by the predictable outcome of management, e.g. analgesia, high dose broad-spectrum antibiotics IV for Gram +ve and Gram –ve bacteria, e.g. co-amoxiclav + flucloxacillin + metronidazole for 4d ± CT guided drainage (send for TB and fungal cultures) or surgical removal.

Ensure patient breathes with mouth open, regularly and deeply, and does not vocalize (e.g. groaning). Reduced breath sounds may be because: • air is not entering/leaving the lung(s); • excess air, fat, or fluid between lung and your stethoscope; • good air entry but abnormal lung parenchyma. Initial investigations (other tests in bold below): FBC, U&E, CXR, ABG. Air is not entering/leaving the lung(s): Main differential diagnoses and typical outline evidence, etc. Poor respiratory effortSuggested by: reduced consciousness/cooperation, any cause of poor chest wall expansion (see E Bilateral poor chest expansion, p.260). Confirmed by: ABG (type 2 failure). Finalized by the predictable outcome of management, e.g. treating cause (e.g. removal of high flow O2, respiratory sedative) and non-invasive ventilation.

This can be explained by oedema gathering along the posterior length of the lungs or less efficient lung movement when the abdominal contents press against the diaphragm. PND can happen when the patient slides down in bed at night or by bron - chospasm due to night-time asthma. Initial investigations (other tests in bold below): FBC, U&E, ECG, and CXR. Main differential diagnoses and typical outline evidence, etc. Pulmonary oedema (due to congestive (chronic) heart failure or left ventricular failure— due to ischaemic heart disease, mitral stenosis, etc.)Suggested by: background fatigue and exertional breathless, cardiac risk factors.
